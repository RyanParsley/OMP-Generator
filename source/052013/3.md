---
Reunion Volunteer Work Project is just around the corner. So far, 95 alumni and friends have signed up to give their time to Antioch June 10-13! Volunteers will be working on a variety of projects including work in the Science Building, on the farm, and in the Office of Advancement preparing for Reunion. If you have a project that could use volunteers (including for office work like filing or shredding), please contact Rebecca Fensler, Alumni Relations Officer for Volunteers and Chapters at [rfensler@antiochcollege.org](rfensler@antiochcollege.org). *Volunteers are required to complete a Confidentiality Agreement, which is on file in the Office of Alumni Relations.*
