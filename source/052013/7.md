title: Antioch College Menu and Announcement

**Antioch Kitchens asks that people visiting the dining hall please not remove dishes, cups, mugs, silverware, chairs etc. from the dining room. We can provide reusable and compostable to-go items for coffee, tea, food upon request. Thank you for your cooperation.**

The North Hall Dining Room opens at 12:00 p.m. and we serve until lunch until 1:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.  We ask that faculty, staff, and visitors offer $5.00, paid via the "honor system," to a deposit safe located near the front entrance of the dining room. We also ask that shoes and shirts be worn in the dinning room at all times and that food not be taken "to-go" unless you are unable to join us for a meal during the established meal time. Thank you!
