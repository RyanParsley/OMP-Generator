title: Free lunch on May 21 in North Hall
---

Community Governance is sponsoring a free lunch for all faculty and staff, including Glen Helen and WYSO employees on May 21 in North Hall. CG is covering the usual $5 charge, so why not come on down and enjoy some of Antioch Kitchens' delicious food whilst shmoozing and mingling, perhaps with some people to whom you've never spoken? If all goes well this will become a monthly event. 

Please RSVP to [Seth Kaplan](mailto:skaplan@antiochcollege.org) so we can get a rough count.

Hope to see you there!
