## :: Design Build Project: Message from Sara Black 

On May 4th and 5th 2013, a collaborative group of architects, designers,
and builders including Professor of Sculpture Rod Northcutt (Miami
University), Architect and Urban Planner Charlie Vinz (Rebuild
Foundation), and Professor of Visual Arts Sara Black (Antioch College)
will lead the next phase of the Tea Pavilion Design Build Project with
Antioch College students and community members. Student participants who
have worked to develop the tea pavilion thus far include: Sam Senzek,
Maisie Taibbi, Rachael Smith, Nargees Jumahan, Adam Abraham, Gabe
Amrhein, Cleo van der Veen and Ben Daniels. Community members include
Nevin Mercede, Jim Rose, Joshua Miller, Tomaz Williams, Carissa Burkett,
Ethan Miller, Dennie Eagleson and Antioch College Farm Director Kat
Christen.

The process began last April with a design charrette in which students
developed an innovative design for the structure developed around the
ritual process of building, the event of harvesting, steeping and
drinking tea inspired by many cultures, and the importance of 'water' on
the farm. Since the charrette just over one year ago, students and
community members in Yellow Springs along with the grounds crew at
Antioch College took down and salvaged the material from the existing
structure built in the 1970's, poured footings for the new structure,
pulled up the concrete from the non-functioning pond, placed a stone
'foot print' using stones harvested by hand from a nearby limestone
quarry, constructed and roofed the renewed Tea Shelter structure,
partially constructed a cordwood and mortar wall.

Materials have included a mix of soft and hard cordwoods from the Glen
(as donated by George Bieri), a local source (as donated by Paul
Abendroth), White Oak salvaged from the floor of the previous structure
(now the posts and lintels), White Oak floor joists (as donated to the
project by Richard Lapedes with the help of Richard Zopf), and limestone
from the nearby quarry.

This weekend it is our goal to complete the cordwood and mortar wall and
realize the rain catchment system. If time allows we may begin working
to line and landscape the adjacent pond. If you are AT ALL interested in
joining the crew for the weekend, please come! We will begin working on
Saturday and Sunday at 9 am and finish around 5pm. We will have a one
hour lunch break each day.

Please RSVP to Sara Black if you would like to participate:
[sblack@antiochcollege.org](mailto:sblack@antiochcollege.org).

I look forward to seeing you this weekend!

## :: Documentary film screening: *When the Iron Bird Flies* 

The Dharma Center along with Antioch College invites everyone to the
screening of the new documentary film, When the Iron Bird Flies, on
Sunday, May 5 at 7:00 p.m. at the Glen Building. An up-close and
personal journey following the astounding path of one of the world's
great spiritual traditions from the caves of Tibet to the mainstream of
Western culture. The film highlights the provocative exchange between
Buddhist practitioners and Western scientists and educators now at the
heart of the emergence of a genuine Western tradition of Buddhism. The
film's producer and co-director, Amber Bemak a 2002 Antioch grad,
Antioch Buddhist Studies India alum, and former Dharma Center resident,
will be on hand to answer questions about her film. Admission is free!
