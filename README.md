# This is an HTML email generator poweredby [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/welcome/) and [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/)

This tool allows you to take a modern aproach (Haml, Sass, Markdown...) to creating HTML then
translates that into bullet resistant html email by injecting styles
into the appropriate places inline.

## For convenience sake
I created a "build.command" file so that people who are "terminal adverse" can build from finder.
